### Research

Based on a literature review of sit-stand desks by Jack Callaghan, sit-stand desks decrease discomfort in sedentary work and do not reduce productivity. Several of the included studies suggested an increase in productivity with sit-stand desks. While the ideal ratio of sitting to standing is unknown, most studies recommended the ratio to be somewhere between 3:1 and 1:3 sit-to-stand depending on various outcome measures. 

This desktop widget lets you customize and trial sit-stand ratios to tune into your preferences.
